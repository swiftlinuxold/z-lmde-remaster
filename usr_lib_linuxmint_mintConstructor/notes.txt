CHANGES TO MAKE TO THE mintConstructor.py SCRIPT:

*  Use the fldiff program to compare mintConstructor.py from the new version of LMDE to that of the old version of LMDE.
Then make these changes to the version of mintConstructor.py used for the previous Swift Linux release.

*  Update the self.isoFilename value.

*  Update the first line that begins with 'change_text (file_isolinux,'.
